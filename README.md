# Clone And Use 📋

- The website is completely built on `react-js` framework of `javascript` and that's why we need `nodejs` and `npm` installed.
- While installing `nodejs` and `npm`, try to install versions which are equal or greater than the versions mentioned in badges above.
- In case you want to help developing it or simply saving it, you can fork the repository just by clicking the button on the top-right corner of this page.
- After the successful installation of `nodejs` and `npm`, clone the repository into your local system using below command:
  - ```python
     git clone https://github.com/ritwik2994/masterPortfolio.git
    ```
  - This will clone the whole repository in your system.
- To download required dependencies to your system, navigate to the directory where the cloned repository resides and execute following command:
  - ```python
    npm install
    ```
- Now, the project is ready to use.
- You can check it using `npm start`, it will open the website locally on your browser.

# Customize it to make your own portfolio ✏️

In this project, there are basically 3 things that you need to change to customize this to anyone else's portfolio: **package.json**, **Personal Information** and **Github Information**.

### package.json

Open this file, which is in the root directory, choose any "name" and change "homepage " to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io`. Do not forget the `https://`, otherwise fonts will not load.

### Personal Information

You will find `src/portfolio.js` file which contains the complete information about the user. The file looks something like below:

```python
// Home Page
const greeting = {
    ...
}

// Social Media
const socialMediaLinks = {
    ...
}

...
```

You can change the personal information, experience, education, social media, certifications, blog information, contact information etc. in `src/portfolio.js` to directly reflect them in portfolio website.

### Github Information

In the root directory there is a `.env_example` file. Open it and copy all the contents, now create a new file `.env` in the root directory and paste all the contents there. 
You will see below components in the file. Now you need to change only the components.

```python
  GITHUB_TOKEN = YOUR GITHUB TOKEN 
  GITHUB_USERNAME = YOUR USERNAME
```
You can get a github token as described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). Give all permissions while generating token. Also add your `GITHUB_USERNAME` in the correct field inside `.env`.
Now, you need to run following command.

```python
node git_data_fetcher.js
```

This will fetch all the data from your github and it will automatically replace my data with yours.
Whenever you want to update the github related information on the website you need to run this command.


You will find `git_data_fetcher.js` file in the root directory of the repository. This file is used to fetch the data (Pull requests, Issues, Organizations, Pinned projects etc.) from your github.



# Choose Theme 🌈

- You can take a look at `src/theme.js` file where all available themes are mentioned with respective color codes.
- At the bottom of this file you will see the below code:
  - `export const chosenTheme = blueTheme;`
  - You need to change the name from `blueTheme` to whatever theme you want to set your website to.
  - You can define new theme similarly as other themes and you can assign name of that new defined theme to `chosenTheme`.
- That's it. You just need to change the theme name and the code will take care of everything else.

  Run `npm start` to check if everything is ok.

# Deployment 📦

- Once you are done with your setup and have successfully completed all steps above, you need to put your website online!
- I highly recommend using [Github Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) to achieve this the EASIEST WAY.
- To deploy your website, you have two options. First you need to create a github repository with the name `<your-github-username>.github.io`. Please don't give it any other name.
- Now, you need to generate a production build and deploy the website.

**Option 1:**

- Run `npm run build` to generate the production build folder.
- Enter the build folder, `git init` and push the generated code to the `master` branch of your new repository. That's it. Done.
  You may need to `git init` and force push at every new build.

**Option 2 (will not work with [user pages](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)):**

- Run `npm run deploy` to build and create a branch called `gh-pages`. It will push the `build` files to that branch.
- The last step in deploying is to enable `Github Pages` in settings of the repository and select `gh-pages` branch.

Now, your website is successfully deployed and you can visit it at `<your-github-username>.github.io`.
